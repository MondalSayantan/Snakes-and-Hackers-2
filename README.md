# Snakes-and-Hackers-2

I named the website ‘Stakes and Games’. Small games like Tic Tac Toe were a part of everybody’s childhood. Placing some petty bets on these games was also very common. I took this small part of our childhood and converted it into an enthralling online experience. You can create game rooms, or join an existing game to play with your friends. But there is a twist. You have to bet something from Amazon. Just enter the Amazon link while creating or joining a game, and a script will run that would automatically scrape the product data from Amazon. Now both the players are going to battle for their choice of product. No game is complete without a bit of trash talk, so I integrated a chat platform specific to that game room.
